Repository for FINM 35910 Applied Algorithmic Trading Final Project, taught by Christopher Gersch.


Idea generation for final project

- Pairs trading on a specific sector of the S&P.
- Finding co-integrated pairs by optimizing entry, exit threshold and window size using calibration and test period (test-train split 80/20). 
- Test different correlation levels
- Filter out stocks with certain dollar volume threshold (maybe 1B)
- Weight dependent on dollar value 
- Transaction cost 1 bps of gross dollar
- Consider monthly rebalancing over test period
